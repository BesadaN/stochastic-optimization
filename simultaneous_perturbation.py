# Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation

# In this file, I'm suggesting that you implement the simultaneous perturbation estimator for the gradient, as
# documented in equation 6.6 of Spall, http://www.jhuapl.edu/spsa/PDF-SPSA/Handbook04_StochasticOptimization.pdf.
# As noted in the README.txt and in main.py
