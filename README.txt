Main references for this assignment:

Stochastic Optimization

** http://www.jhuapl.edu/spsa/PDF-SPSA/Handbook04_StochasticOptimization.pdf (particularly Section 6.3.2)

This is how I described doing high-dimensional minimization problems.

Collaborative Filtering

** https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/f26nH/collaborative-filtering-algorithm (Lecture 98 of Ng's Course)
** https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/papers/cf_slides-pml09.pdf

If you don't want to learn Stochastic Optimization, then use the Gradient Descent algorithm described toward the end of Ng's Lecture 98.

I am at present unclear how lambda is meant to be chosen. For now, I just hard-coded it to 1.0.
